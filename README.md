It displays a profile photo, a navigation menu (HOME, ABOUT, SERVICES, BLOG, MORE), a "Contact" button, and an introduction section with your name, title ("Web Developer"), a short description, and a "Download CV" button. All layout and colors are handled with inline CSS, and images are currently loaded from local file paths.
